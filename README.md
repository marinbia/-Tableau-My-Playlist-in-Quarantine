# TableauProject 

In this project, I collected my personal music streaming data, provided by Spofity. I did the ETL part, inserted it into Tableau and built this visualization, inspired by a project I had already seen in Public Tableau.

* 1º I collected the data from Spotify;
* 2º I did the data processing part, that is, define what is a number, what is a date, what is a letter etc;
* 3º I made the template on powerpoint, based on the colors of spotify;
* 4º Define what I wanted to present on the dashboard, which in this case would be the KPIs in a more businesslike way. In this case, I defined Top5 Artists and Top5 Songs, streaming data in general and monthly breakdown of hours I listened to music on spotify.
* 5º Search the formulas I would use in Tableau to be able to show the indicators i defined as most important
* 6º Analyse the final result and make some ajustments.
* 7º See the results and inputs, which are: 
     I listen to male artists more than women;
     I had a listening slump in february because i was on vacation and i listen to more music when i'm working, during business hours;
     I discovered almost triple the number of new songs compared to new artists.
